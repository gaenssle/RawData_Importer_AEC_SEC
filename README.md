The SEC and AEC (Peak) Data Importer are small programs I have written in Python 3.5.
- Processes raw chromatography data saved in .txt or .csv files
- They import all the files for one data set (run) and combines all the samples in one single spread sheet with a common axis
- All three works after the same principle and simply differ in the type of files they import.
- They import all text files in a folder and accumulate all the samples into a set of export files.
- They do not have an GUI
